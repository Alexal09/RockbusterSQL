SQL querries to segment customer groups using inner join, group by, a limit count.

1.	Average amount paid by the top 5 customers
WITH customer_information_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, Total_customer_payment) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city, SUM(E.amount) AS Total_customer_payment
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city, e.amount),

    top10_countries (country) AS
    (SELECT country
    FROM customer_information_cte
    GROUP BY country
    ORDER BY COUNT (*) DESC
    LIMIT 10),
    Top10_cities (city) AS
    (SELECT city
    FROM customer_information_cte
    WHERE country IN(SELECT country FROM top10_countries)
    GROUP BY city

GROUP BY country, city, Total_customer_payment

LIMIT 5

2.	How many of the top 5 customers are based within each country
WITH customer_information_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, Total_customer_payment) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city, SUM(E.amount) AS Total_customer_payment

    LIMIT 10),

    (SELECT city

    WHERE country IN(SELECT country FROM top10_countries)
    GROUP BY city
    ORDER BY COUNT (*) DESC 
    LIMIT 10)

SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, Total_customer_payment AS Top5_cxpayment

GROUP BY customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, Total_customer_payment
ORDER BY AVG(Total_customer_payment) DESC 
LIMIT 5

3. Original: Average amount paid by the top 5 customers

SELECT AVG (Total_customer_payment) AS Average
FROM
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city,
SUM(e.amount) AS Total_customer_payment

WHERE city IN('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki',
             'Pingxiang', 'Silvas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY COUNT (amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid

4. Original: How many of the top 5 customers are based within each country

SELECT DISTINCT (A.country),
COUNT (DISTINCT D.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT (DISTINCT A.country) AS Top_customer_count
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON b.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
LEFT JOIN (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city, SUM(e.amount) AS Total_customer_payment
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE country IN('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil',
	'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
AND c.city IN('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki',
             'Pingxiang', 'Silvas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY COUNT (amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS TOP_5_customers ON A.country = Top_5_customers.COUNTRY
GROUP BY A.country, top_5_customers
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
