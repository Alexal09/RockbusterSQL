SQL data cleaning and data summarizing

1.	Check for and clean dirty data:
non-uniform
 
SELECT DISTINCT rating
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
 
SELECT DISTINCT store_id
FROM customer
GROUP BY store_id
 
duplicate data
 
SELECT film_id, title, description, release_year, language_id, rental_duration,
COUNT (*)
FROM film
GROUP BY film_id, title, description, release_year, language_id, rental_duration
HAVING COUNT (*)>1
 
SELECT customer_id, store_id, first_name, last_name, email, active,
COUNT (*)
FROM customer
GROUP BY customer_id, store_id, first_name, last_name, email, active
HAVING COUNT (*)>1
 
missing values

SELECT COUNT (film_id) AS Total_film_id_count,
COUNT (title) AS Total_title_count,
COUNT (description) AS Total_description_count,
COUNT (release_year) AS Total_release_year_count,
COUNT (language_id) AS Total_language_id_count,
COUNT (rental_duration) AS Total_rental_duration_count,
COUNT (rental_rate) AS Total_rental_rate_count,
COUNT (length) AS Total_length_count,
COUNT (replacement_cost) AS Total_replacement_cost_count,
COUNT (rating) AS Total_rating_count,
COUNT(*) AS Total_row_count
FROM film
 
SELECT COUNT (customer_id) AS Total_customer_id_count,
COUNT (store_id) AS Total_store_id_count,
COUNT (first_name) AS Total_first_name_count,
COUNT (last_name) AS Total_last_name_count,
COUNT (email) AS Total_email_count,
COUNT (address_id) AS Total_address_id_count,
COUNT(*) AS Total_row_count
FROM customer


2.	Summarize your data

Numerical Film 

SELECT MIN(rental_duration) AS Min_rent_duration,
MAX(rental_duration) AS Max_rent_duration,
AVG(rental_duration) AS AVG_rent_duration,
MIN(rental_rate) AS Min_rental_rate,
MAX(rental_rate) AS Max_rental_rate,
AVG(rental_rate) AS AVG_rental_rate,
MIN(length) AS Min_length,
MAX(length) AS Max_length,
AVG(length) AS AVG_length,
MIN(replacement_cost) AS MIN_replacement_cost,
MAX(replacement_cost) AS MAX_replacement_cost,
AVG(replacement_cost) AS AVG_replacement_cost
FROM film

 
Non-numerical Film 

SELECT MODE()WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY title)
AS modal_title,
MODE()WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY description)
AS modal_description,
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY release_year)
AS modal_release_year,
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating)
AS modal_rating
FROM film

 

Numerical Customer

SELECT MIN(customer_id) AS Min_customer_id,
MAX(customer_id) AS Max_rent_duration,
AVG(customer_id) AS AVG_customer_id,
MIN(store_id) AS Min_store_id,
MAX(store_id) AS Max_store_id,
AVG(store_id) AS AVG_store_id,
MIN(address_id) AS Min_address_id,
MAX(address_id) AS Max_address_id,
AVG(address_id) AS AVG_address_id,
MIN(active) AS MIN_active,
MAX(active) AS MAX_active,
AVG(active) AS AVG_active
FROM customer

 
Non-Numerical Customer

SELECT MODE()WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY first_name)
AS modal_first_name,
MODE()WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY last_name)
AS modal_last_name,
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY email)
AS modal_email
FROM customer
